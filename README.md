# Master Javascript tutorial at 4Geeks Academy

> Proposed by [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr) and [other contributors](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-javascript-programming-exercises/graphs/contributors) at [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.co/)

**160 Javascript exercises**

*Exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string. My recommendation is to ignore the tests and to use them only as a recommendation or you can get frustrated.*

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **app.js**: Represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md**: Contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js**: Contains the testing script for the exercise (you don't have to open this file).
